    <p>In December 2017, I left my job to travel around the world to discover new talents. In every country I visited over the next 12 months, I arranged to meet, interviewed and photograph one person working in the creative field. My goal was to meet people, discover talents and design industries that are sometimes underrepresented, and show that everyone has an interesting story to tell, no matter when they come from. I asked them about their story, their process and the industry they are working in. <br/><br/>I did the transcript of those interviews in order to create a website containing all those articles. To build a side project, it’s essential to underestimate the amount of work required. It took me more than two years to do this project and I don’t regret any seconds I put into it. There is a lot of countries out there I haven’t been to yet so Esperanto will forever be a work in progress.</p>
