      I am proud to present my latest portfolio project, a messenger application
      developed using the MERN stack and Socket.io. As the sole designer and
      developer, I conceptualized and executed the project from the ground up,
      delivering a polished and user-friendly solution that demonstrates my
      proficiency in web development. The application boasts real-time messaging
      capabilities, a seamless user experience, and a modern design aesthetic,
      all of which were achieved through a dedicated development period of 6
      weeks.

        I utilized Sketch to create the design for the project. For the
        front-end, I used React in conjunction with Styled-Components for
        component styling and Redux-toolkit for state management. The back-end
        was developed using Express and MongoDB, and Socket.io was implemented
        for real-time messaging functionality.
