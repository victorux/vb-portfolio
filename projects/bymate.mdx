    <p>
      For my final year project, I designed and developed ByMate, a web app to
      help students and others find housing or roommates. I conducted research,
      designed the UI, created prototypes, crafted the logo, and built the
      full-stack application with a user-friendly interface. The project
      involved front-end development with React & TypeScript, back-end
      development with Node.js and Express, and database management using MySQL.
